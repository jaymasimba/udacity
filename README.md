#### Project 1: Trading with Momentum Strategy
This project implements a momentum trading strategy and perform a statistical test on the mean returns to conclude if there is alpha on the momentum generated trading signals
For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

#### Project 2: Breakout Strategy
In this project, we explore the possibility of profiting from a breakout strategy using  a Histogram and p-values. 
We will be using the end of day dataset from Quotemedia

#### Project 3: Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization 
This project builds a smart beta portfolio and compare it to a benchmark index. We also calculate the tracking error against the index to evaluate its performance and eventually build a portfolio using quadratic programming to optimize the weights and then rebalance the portfolio calculating the turnover. 
We used the end of day data from Quotemedia for the dataset

#### Project 4: Alpha Research and Factor Modelling
This project builds a statistical risk model using PCA and then uses the risk model to build a portfolio a long with the following alpha factors
* Momentum 1 Year Factor
* Mean Reversion 5 Day Sector Neutral Factor
* Mean Reversion 5 Day Sector Neutral Smoothed Factor
* Overnight Sentiment Factor
* Overnight Sentiment Smoothed Factor

The project analyses the alpha factors using factor weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio and turnover analysis and  eventually optimizes the portfolio
